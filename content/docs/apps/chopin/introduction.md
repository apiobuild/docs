## Use Case

There are many online store builders you can choose from. While the basic plan can be as low as $18 per month, these costs can add up quickly as the business grow. You’re already paying a lot of startup costs: web-hosting, domain name, email marketing, why add more monthly fees to your overhead?

To better serve different business models and needs, these services strive for developing as many features as possible. The options available on the settings page and the enormous plug-ins sometimes can be quite intimidating to a new user.

- [small business owners](https://apiobuild.com/blog/starting-an-online-store-with-chopin-and-instagram/)
