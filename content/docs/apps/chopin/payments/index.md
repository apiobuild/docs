While credit card is the mainstream payment method supported by most e-commerce platforms, we recognize many smaller businesses don't have POS or even a dedicated bank account. Therefore we have many customized payment options available. We are always looking to support as many payment methods as we possibly could. Reach out to us to add new payment methods."

{{< img src="e_payment_button_21.png" >}}

Each payment method will appear as a **button** on your store. If you don't add any payment options, there will be a **"Submit Order"** button. You can enable as many payment options as you'd like.

Visit our [Demo Store](https://chopin.apiobuild.com/demo-store) and see how they work in real world. If you don't see your preferred payment methods, [drop us a message â†’]({{<ref "/docs/introduction/introduction/index.md#contact-us" >}})

## Order Minimum

Your customers' order total has to be greater than the minimum amount set to be able to place the order.

## Currency

Store currency is default to USD (US Dollar). Choose your preferred currency code from the dropdown menu.

## Online Payment Processors

Integrating online payment platforms allows Chopin to **verify transactions and post the result in realtime** to order google sheet. Merchants will no longer have to manually confirm and verify each payment from customers.

### Stripe

We currently support [Stripe](https://stripe.com/payments) as online payment processor for our [Basic tier users](https://apiobuild.com/#pricing). This allows customers pay with credit cards and debit cards.

[Contact us to integrate Stripe account with your Chopin store â†’]({{<ref "/docs/introduction/introduction/index.md#contact-us" >}})

Stripe impose processing fee of **2.9% + 30Â¢**. The fee will be deducted directly from your any payment you received via Stripe. apio doesn't take additional cut from your profits!

## Offline (Manual) Payment Options

We also support popular manual payment options across North America. Manual payment means that the transaction will be handled outside of the Chopin checkout process and we won't be able to verify these payments on your behalf. The payment method selected by the customer will be posted to order google sheet.

Provide your [Paypal.Me link](/docs/apps/chopin/troubleshoot/#how-to-set-up-paypalme). It should look like: `https://www.paypal.me/youraccount`.
