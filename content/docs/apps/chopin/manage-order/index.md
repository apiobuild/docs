## Order Google Sheet

When creating your Chopin store, you already copied the title row to you Order Google Sheet. If we roll out new features or you add new custom fields, the new columns will be created automatically.

Feel free to change the order and move columns around. You can even hide the columns you don't want to see. However, the **`order_number` cell should always be on A1**.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="See more FAQs about Order Sheet â†’" rel-href="/docs/apps/chopin/troubleshoot/#order-google-sheet">}}

### A successful order

Each order consists of multiple rows:

- 1st row: The first row includes everything but the [product details](#product-details).
- 2nd ~ Nth rows: The next few rows display only the [purchased product(s) details](#product-details). 
  - Each product gets its own row. 
  - N = How many unique products your customers buy.
- (N+1)th row: When there're additional [events](#event-type) happened (i.e. payment method changed, credit card failed), you will see additional rows posted with only [payment details](#payment-details).

The `order_number` and `order_number_short` will appear on all the rows that belong to the same order.
