## 1. Open Chopin Stores Flow

Go to [Chopin Store Flow](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/flow/chopin-stores) on [Telescope](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/). Log in with your Google account.

{{< alert icon="‚ö†Ô∏è" text="Click <b>Sign in with Google</b> instead of entering email and password" >}}

## 2. Name the Store

{{< alert icon="‚ö†Ô∏è" text="Store name cannot be changed later, but you can always create a new store." >}}

The name will be shown on top of the store.

## 3. Create Catalog Google Sheet

Follow the steps on the flow to create a new Google Sheet as your **catalog**, this sheet is where you add product details and prices.

## 4. Create Order Google Sheet

Repeat the same steps above to create another Google Sheet, which will be storing **new orders** from the customers.

{{< alert icon="üí°" text="You can add more columns to the Google Sheets as needed." >}}

Note: manage your orders on the Google Sheets in your preferred way. For example, you could add new columns such as `order_shipped`, `order_completed`, `notes`, etc. to flag whether the order is made, shipped or fulfilled.

## 5. (Optional) Authorize Email to Send Order Confirmation

{{< alert icon="‚ö†Ô∏è" text="Currently we only support Gmail." >}}

You can enable email confirmation with any Gmail account. Click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>(plus sign) to grant us permission to send email on your behalf.

*This step is optional. You don't have to add anything if you don't plan to send email confirmation. You can also add this later by going to the [Post-it app](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/app/post-it).*

## üéâ Open for Business

That's it! You are now a proud owner of Chopin store. Visit your new store or go to [Chopin App](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/app/chopin) to configure your store. Tap through the next page to learn how to edit your catalog and set up your store.
