## Story

[Atelier EHOI](https://chopin.apiobuild.com/atelierehoi) is one of the first users who [joined Chopin in 2020](https://apiobuild.com/blog/starting-an-online-store-with-chopin-and-instagram/). The owner/pastry chef Taihee started sharing her [French-Asian fusion baked goods](https://medium.com/four-petite-foodies/atelier-ehoi-freshly-baked-goods-worth-saving-room-for-6efff97897a3) with sweet tooth New Yorkers during the global pandemic when people were craving quality desserts while staying at home.

> *Chopin makes it really convenient for my customers, as they can see everything we offer from our website. It is very easy to manage the website. We like the fact that we can change contents like product description and picture anytime we want. I believe the website benefits our business.*

### Challenge

Ran by the couple duo who fulfills and deliver orders on their own, Atelier EHOI was looking for a tool to help them collect orders easily without taking too much of their baking time. They tried Google Forms and Instagram DM, which aren't able to integrate payments and create an extra layer for customers to make a purchase.

- Other website builders aren't really that easy for beginners with no experience.
- Social media pages (Facebook, Instagram) can't display all the menu at once.
- Google Forms doesn't have the checkout function for order calculation and collect payments.

### Result

With Chopin, Taihee and her husband Jeff built a online dessert store within one day that can  update weekly special menu easily and view orders in Google Sheets. They also utilize the automatic confirmation emails to inform customers with payment and delivery information.

- Their Chopin store was built from zero to live within 1 day!
- Powered by Google Sheets makes Chopin store very easy to maintain.
- Customers are able to view all the items, review order, and checkout all at one place.
