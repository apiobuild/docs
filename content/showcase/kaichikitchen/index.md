## Story

Atelier EHOI is one of the first users join Chopin! The owner/pastry chef Taihee bakes all of their French-Asian fusion desserts herself and run the business with her husband Jeff. Baking and delivery takes most of their time and they were in need of a tool to help them collect orders easily. Prior to Chopin, they were collecting orders through Google Forms and Instagram DM, which aren't very straightfordward for customers in terms of how and how much to pay. Ordering through private messages also creates an extra layer for customers to make a purchase.
