## Story

Catmint Wheel Cake has been a NYC food festival favorite serving the popular Taiwanese dessert since 2016 and opened their first brick and mortar location in the heart of Manhattan two years later. During the global pandemic in 2020, without too much of foot traffic in Manhattan, they decied to close the physical store and bring their sales online.

### Challenge

Catmint has experimented all possible options until they found Chopin. They tried the Square ordering site came with their POS system as well as tried to add the e-commerce function to their existing Wix website. However, they found that the monthly plan, payment processing fee, and hosting cost for these website builders could add up to over $30 per month, which wasn't ideal as they were just testing this new online model. They also tried collecting order through a LINE group chat that became chaotic and impossible to track orders.

- The monthly costs for other ecommerce platforms can add up to a small but still significant investment, which is not beginner-friendly.
- Collecting orders through group messages makes it difficult for both merchants and customers to track orders.

### Result

Being used to the convenience of online order system, Catmint came on board to Chopin pretty quickly. With the upgraded plan at less than $10 per month, Catmint enjoys an optimized website with custom URL and no ads placement. Catmint delivers to different parts of New York every week, and it took quite some time to manually verify customers' addresses and communicate this rule with their customers. apio was able to team up with Catmint to develop the [zipcode validation feature]({{< ref "/docs/apps/chopin/order-settings/index.md#delivery-zipcode" >}}) that is beneficial to other users as well.

- Create an e-commerce website on par with most website builders but at zero or low cost.
- Enjoy custom features while [sharing costs with other businesses](https://apiobuild.com/blog/why-do-we-create-apio/#sharing-costs-with-other-businesses).
