## Story

Una believes knowledge is power and has always been researching and sourcing great children's books from different parts of the world for her little boy. With her background and interests in performing arts, Una incorporates story-telling with fun craft and movement activities. Like many mompreneurs, Una started from sharing her story time with the local parents group in California. Eventually, more and more children around the world get to learn something new while having fun.

>*Chopin's interface is very simple and not as sophisticated as other website builders. It's actually good for the business. I've never heard one parent can't figure out how to order and they can all find the information they need from my Chopin store. ... I really like Chopin's customer support! The support team always solves my questions in a timely manner and provides detailed instruction. Knowing you can get instant support from a website provider really gives me confidence to run an online business.*

## Challenge

As the business grows, Una becomes overwhelmed by having to manually verify payments with each parents, which involves multiple back-and-forth emails and bank account checkups. Not to mention that the account information and payment totals can get mixed up during those communications. Una was using Google Forms and couldn't find a way to integrate a more efficient payment method. She was also spending too much time on monitor the sign-up/payment status, as she needed to close certain class options if they filled up. All these administrative and repetitive tasks have taken her precious time and energy to develop her curriculum.

- Manually verifying payments becomes too time-consuming and allows lots of human errors.
- Need a simple inventory management system to limit the class size.

## Result

With the help from Chopin's support team, transitioning from Google Forms to Google-Sheets-based Chopin works out smoothly. Una can even use simple functions to stay on top of the student counts for each class. If the class registration reaches the limit set in Google Sheets, the item will show "sold out" on the website. With a simple [pivot table]({{< ref "/docs/apps/chopin/analyze-order/index.md#pivot-table" >}}) set-up, Una uses her order sheet data to create a dynamic dashboard that shows registration list for each month. Now she can easily visualize the class sign-up and further identify her target audience, which is beneficial for placing advertisement on social media.

Intergrated with Stripe payment, her customers can pay for the classes directly with credit cards. Only successful transactions will go through the system, so there's no need to confirm payment manually. Chopin's payment gateway is fairly flexible, which allows users to set up multiple payment methods. Una also has a PayPal.Me link at checkout to provide more options.

- Chopin unlocks more of Google Sheets. With some simple functions and formulas, inventory management, data analysis, sales dashboard are all possible within the Order Sheet.
- Stripe integration to enjoy the benefit of payment verification.
- Flexible payment gateway options to display multiple payment options.
